## Import data

“Share of people who respond they are "very happy" or "rather happy" to the question "Taking all things together, would you say you are … ?"”

#  {.tabset}

## 🔢 Table

```{r}
happy %>% 
  filter(Year %in% c(1993, 2022)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = Year, values_from = `Happiness: Happy (aggregate)`, id_cols = Country) %>% 
  select(Country, `1993`, `2022`) %>% 
  mutate(`Absolute change` = round(`2022` - `1993`, 3)) %>% 
  mutate(`Relative change` = (`2022` - `1993`) / `1993`) %>% 
  reactable(
    columns = list(`Relative change` = colDef(format = colFormat(percent = TRUE, digits = 1))) 
  )
```

## 🌎 Map

```{r}
happy %>% 
  mutate(`Happiness: Happy (aggregate)` = round(`Happiness: Happy (aggregate)`, 2)) %>%
  plot_geo(width = 950, height = 500) %>% 
  add_trace(
    z = ~`Happiness: Happy (aggregate)`,
    color = ~`Happiness: Happy (aggregate)`,
    locations = ~Code,
    text = ~Country,
    frame = ~Year, colors = "YlGn",
    colorbar = list(title = "% of happy/very happy people")
    ) %>% 
  layout(
    title = "Share of people who say they are happy, 1992-2022",
    geo = list(
      projection = list(type = "natural earth"),
      showframe = FALSE,
      showcoastlines = TRUE
      ),
    margin = list(l = 0, r = 0, t = 40, b = 20)
  )


```

## 📈 Chart

```{r}
# simple line chart of the data, for five countries on different continents (ggplot, piped into ggplotly)

happy_chart <- 
  happy %>% 
  filter(Country %in% c("Norway", "Australia", "South Africa", "Argentina", "Egypt", "Japan")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = `Happiness: Happy (aggregate)`, color = Country)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 100)) +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "% of respondents happy or very happy", 
       color = "Country",
       title = "Share of people who say they are happy, 1993 to 2022",
       subtitle = "% of respondents replying very happy/ quite happy") +
  theme_minimal() 

ggplotly(happy_chart, width = 950, length = 920)
```

## Advanced (Optional) 📈

The following chart demonstrates that it is possible to approximate the functionality of our World in Data grapher for multicountry selection using R, specifically with the `crosstalk` package and a small amount of custom JavaScript. For more information on how to achieve this, see [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67058016/how-to-set-default-values-in-filter-select-in-crosstalk-in-r-plotly).

Note that this is not a required task, but rather a showcase of what can be achieved. The code for this will be shared when we provide the solutions for the exercise.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(crosstalk)


# Crosstalk shared data
shared_happy <- highlight_key(happy)

happy_plotly <- plot_ly(
  shared_happy, 
  x = ~Year, 
  y = ~`Happiness: Happy (aggregate)`, 
  color = ~Country, 
  type = "scatter", 
  mode = "lines+markers"
) %>%
  layout(yaxis = list(range = c(0, 100)))


country_filter <- filter_select(
  "country_filter", 
  "Select a country to examine", 
  shared_happy, 
  ~Country, 
  multiple = TRUE
)

bscols(
  list(country_filter, happy_plotly)
)
```

```{=html}
<script>
function filter_default() {
  var default_countries = ["Norway", "Australia", "Germany", "Bolivia", "Colombia", "Bhutan"]; // Set default countries here
  document.getElementById("country_filter").getElementsByClassName("selectized")[0].selectize.setValue(default_countries, false);
}
window.onload = filter_default;
</script>
```
